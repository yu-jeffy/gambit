The board.sol contract sets up a basic chess board with an 8x8 grid, where each cell contains a `Piece` struct with a `PieceType` and a `Player`. The `movePiece` function allows players to move pieces on the board, and the `isValidMove` function checks if a move is valid based on the piece type and game rules.

steps:

1. Set up the initial state of the chess board in the `setupBoard` function.
2. Implement the game rules and piece movements in the `isValidMove` function.
3. Add logic to handle special moves like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
4. Implement a function to check if a player is in check or checkmate.
5. Add access control to ensure that only the two players involved in the game can make moves.
